My name is Phil Lavoie and I'm from Burlington, Vermont.

I am a 2019 University of Vermont (UVM) graduate and am most likely to be found on a bike or skis when not working away in front of a screen.

I currently work as a software engineer at IBM and have an array of interests throughout the different realms and roles within technology. As a software engineer with product owner and quality assurance experience, I have successfully helped facilitate the delivery of a range of products and services providing essential value for end users. Starting in Quality Assurance, I developed an automated testing framework to support 500+ applications and cross-functionally coordinated User Acceptance testing across an organization. I used this experience and insight into customer needs to shift into a product owner / developer role designing and engineering a suite of mobile products solving serious problems in the healthcare arena. As a full stack engineer in agile environments, I have driven new product features and experimentation for user success, bolstered developer experience, and thrived as an interface for product development. Throughout this, I have taken on extra challenge initiatives such as helping lead a business challenge team through user research, design, development, delivery strategy and winning pitch to a panel of executive leaders.

To this point in my career, I have been exposed to a broad range of tools and technologies that have helped form a strong technical sense and ability to adapt and learn in lieu of a deep established specialization. I am highly driven in situations involving creative development that relies on thinking from the user's perspective and interaction with product stakeholders.

As a student, professional, and forever learner, I have worked with an array of languages / tools / technologies including: 

`Java / Java EE` `Python` `React / Node JS` `JavaScript` `jQuery` `Ajax` `HTML` `CSS` `XML` `Velocity` `Docker` `Kubernetes` `SQL / MySQL` `Selenium Webdriver / WebdriverIO` `Git / GitHub` `Jira` `Trello` `MongoDB` `GraphQL` `Jenkins` `Tekton` `Flutter` `Swift` `Xcode` `Android Studio`
