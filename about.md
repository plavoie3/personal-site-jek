My name is Phil!

I graduated from the University of Vermont (UVM) in 2019 with a degree in Computer Science and am most likely to be found on a bike, skis, or out and about with my dog Pinto when not working on or thinking about software product design and development.

Currently, I am working as a Product Manager following a few years of experience as a Software and QA Engineer. In past roles, I have helped facilitate the delivery of a range of products and services providing essential value for end users. Starting in Quality Assurance, I developed an automated testing framework to support a hospital network's 500+ applications and cross-functionally coordinated User Acceptance testing across the organization. I used this experience and insight into end-user needs to shift into a Product Owner / iOS Developer role designing and engineering a suite of mobile products aimed to solve serious problems within the the healthcare setting for various stakeholders. As a full stack engineer in agile environments, I have driven new product features and experimentation for user success, bolstered developer experience, and thrived as an interface for product development. Throughout this, I have taken on extra initiatives such as helping lead a business challenge team through research, design, development, delivery strategy and winning pitch to a panel of executive leaders.

At this point in my career, I have enjoyed being exposed to a broad range of environments, tools and technologies that have helped form a strong technical sense and ability to adapt and learn in lieu of a deep established specialization. I am highly driven in situations requiring thorough problem and idea analysis before designing a value-focused solution 

As a student, professional, and forever learner, I have worked with an array of languages / tools / technologies including: 

`Java / Java EE` `Python` `React / Node JS` `JavaScript` `jQuery` `HTML / CSS` `XML` `Velocity` `Handlebars` `Docker` `Kubernetes` `Tekton` `SQL / MySQL` `Selenium Webdriver / WebdriverIO` `Git / GitHub` `Jira` `Trello` `Azure DevOps` `MongoDB` `GraphQL` `Jenkins`  `Flutter` `Swift / Xcode` `Android Studio`
