---

My name is Phil Lavoie and I was born and raised in Burlington, VT. 

I graduated from the University of Vermont in 2019 and am most likely to be found on a bike or skis when not in front of a screen :D

I currently work as a software engineer at IBM and have interests scattered about the different realms and roles within technology. 

I have experience working as part of a team on products in the healthcare, pharmaceutical, and hardware manufacturing IT industries. 

As a student, intern, and in my current role and personal studies, I have been exposed to an array of languages and tools including: 

`Python` `Java EE` `React / Node JS` `JavaScript` `jQuery` `Ajax` `HTML` `CSS` `SQL` `MySQL` `Docker` `Kubernetes` `Jenkins` `Tekton` `Flutter` `Swift` `Xcode` `Selenium Webdriver` `WebdriverIO` `Android Studio` `C++` `Git / GitHub` `Jira` `Trello`
