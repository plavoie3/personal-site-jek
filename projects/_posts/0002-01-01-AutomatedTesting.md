title: Automated E2E + UI Regression Testing Framework & CI/CD Service
---

<span class="post-date"> (Python + Selenium Webdriver | JavaScript + WebdriverIO | HTML + CSS) </span>

<div class="message"> 

<p> An automated testing framework and service I first developed to support Business Analysts and an enterprise's 500+ SaaS infrastructure that was later applied to a CI/CD process and enhanced with performance tracking / analytics. The service was containerized using <code>Docker</code> to be run as part of a <code>Jenkins</code> pipelines.</p>

<p> I also introduced a version for a JavaScript / React environment using WebDriverIO, <code>Mocha</code>, and <code>Chai</code>. </p>  

<p> Results of this work has eliminated or dramatically reduced manual testing and provided far greater test coverage and monitoring to support healthy deploy processes and lowered the risk of bugs reaching end users. </p>
