<div class="message"> 

<p> My current / WIP learning project focused on putting together these technologies to learn this truly powerful stack! The base project is a social media site with the classic Twitter-like abilities to register a user, create/delete posts, and like/comment on posts.
</p> 

<p> I plan to transition this site into a dog training focused platform to allow a social experience when organizing and comparing products / techniques to cover the core areas of dog training and needs.
