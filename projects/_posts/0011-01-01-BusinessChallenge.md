<p> I had the opportunity to take on a business challenge project in a Product Owner / Technical Lead role as we worked to design and develop an innovative product for our sponsor. This involved researching and understanding a complex infrastructure and identifying how our user-facing mobile app would integrate in a way to provide critical real-time notifications and a robust user interface for incident information and resolution. </p> 

<p>This technical challenge involved deep research, design, and rapid learning of Android development to arrive at a functional MVP for our customer and winning pitch to a panel of executive leaders.</p>
