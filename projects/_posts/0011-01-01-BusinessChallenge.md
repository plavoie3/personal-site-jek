I had the opportunity to take on a business challenge project in the Technical Product Owner role for a team working through ideation, design, development, and delivery planning for a native mobile app/service aimed at solving an increasingly critical identity protection problem. This involved researching a system and problem to identify how our user-facing mobile app would integrate in a way to provide critical real-time notifications and a robust user interface for incident information and resolution. Our MVP and Product pitch to an Executive Panel was awarded 1st Place in competition.
